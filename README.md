# Universal black-box adversarial attacks via cellular automata generated patterns

This is the repository with the code for my Master's Thesis "Black-box adversarial attacks". You can find the full text of this thesis at [`final_thesis.pdf`](final_thesis.pdf).

### Structure

* `attacks.ipynb` contains the code for running all the attacks described in the text
* `true_turing_patterns.ipynb` contains the code for generating Turing patterns via cellular automata and their illustrations
* `turing.py` contains functions that help generate Turing patterns
* `turing_dft.py` contains functions for Fourier transforms of attack patterns
* `drawing.py` contains helper functions for drawing
